      <p class="text">In retaliation, the Indian Army conducted a surgical strike on the night of September 28–29,
        2016.Elite Para Special Forces crossed the Line of Control (LoC) into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and targeted 7
        terrorist launch pads — temporary camps where terrorists were preparing to infiltrate into India.</p>

    <div class="DivCase2-S2">
      <p class="text">The operation was planned with high precision, using intelligence, surveillance drones, and
        satellite images.The soldiers returned safely without any casualties, and the mission was considered a tactical
        and strategic success by Indian authorities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="DivCase3-S2">
      <p class="text">This was the first time India publicly acknowledged a cross-border strike of this nature.It marked
        a shift in India’s military doctrine — from passive defense to proactive and offensive counter-terrorism.It also
        significantly raised domestic morale, received widespread public support, and sent a strong message to Pakistan
        and the international community.
