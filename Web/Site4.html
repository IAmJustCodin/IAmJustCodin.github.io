    <h1 class="text">Kargil War(1999)</h1>
    <p class="text">In May 1999, Pakistani troops and militants secretly crossed the Line of Control (LoC) into Indian territory in the Kargil sector of Jammu & Kashmir. They captured high mountain positions, aiming to disrupt the Srinagar–Leh highway and cut off India’s access to Siachen Glacier.</p>

    <p class="text">The Kargil War was fought in extremely challenging conditions at altitudes over 16,000 feet. Soldiers faced steep climbs, freezing temperatures, and low oxygen levels, while carrying heavy weapons and supplies. It became one of the most notable examples of high-altitude mountain warfare in modern history.</p>

  <div class="DivCase2-S4">
    <p class="text">By July 26, 1999, Indian forces had recaptured most of the occupied peaks, forcing Pakistan to retreat after intense fighting and international pressure. This day is now marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas every year.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="DivCase3-S4">
    <p class="text">The war highlighted the bravery of Indian soldiers, the importance of high-altitude warfare preparation, and the need for stronger surveillance along the LoC. It also boosted India’s image globally for exercising restraint by not crossing into Pakistani territory. </p>
